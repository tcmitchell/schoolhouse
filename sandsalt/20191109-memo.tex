\begin{document}
\maketitle

A member of the Schoolhouse Sand \& Salt committee noticed \textbf{ice} early this morning on the front sidewalk and the left side of the front stairs as you enter the building. This was apparently due to the Schoolhouse sprinklers in combination with the low temperature. The committee called an \textbf{emergency meeting} and discussed the situation. It was unanimously agreed that sand and salt should made available immediately so that residents had ready access to mitigate the threat.

After the meeting, members of the committee leapt into action. Sand \emph{and} salt dispensers were placed at the front door and the parking lot door. The containers were filled to approximately three quarters full so that they aren't too heavy for residents to lift.

The committee decided that it was premature to put shovels at the doors. We're barely into November and hardly any snow is forecast. The Sand \& Salt committee will continue to monitor the weather forecast and will make every effort to have shovels at the doors before any substantial snow is upon us.
