% \section*{Summary}

Out of an abundance of caution, and due to the
Massachusetts COVID-19 State of Emergency
and the Boston Public Health Emergency, we have decided to postpone the May
condominium water leak
checks. We plan to reevaluate every few weeks and when conditions
allow we will conduct them.
