\section*{Summary}

The Schoolhouse water leak checks were performed on Saturday, November 9 between 9:30 a.m. and 11:00 a.m. 20 units were checked for water leaks. No major issues were found. We made simple adjustments to approximately 3 toilets to prevent overflow before the next water checks in Spring 2020.

\section*{Notes}

\begin{itemize}

\item The owner of \textbf{Unit G5} was informed that their toilet would probably need an adjustment in the next 6 - 12 months to prevent overflow. We are not familiar with the inner workings of this toilet, and offered our assistance if the owner would like help making the adjustment.

\item \textbf{Unit 11} was not checked. The owner was away and asked us to skip the unit because of a skittish cat. This unit was also skipped in May, so it is overdue for a check. We will work to arrange a time with the owner to perform the leak checks soon.

\item The in-wall toilet in \textbf{Unit 21} has been repaired and was \emph{not} leaking! In May, as reported to the board, it was leaking steadily.

\item The resident of \textbf{Unit 23} had positive feedback for Chase \& Tolan Plumbing \& Heating, who fixed the toilet issues detected by the May water leak checks.

\end{itemize}

There was nothing else of note in the other 17 units that were checked.
